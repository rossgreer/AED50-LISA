# AED50-LISA

The code in this repository was developed for the Transportation Forecasting Competition (TRANSFOR 22) 2022 TRB Annual Meeting Workshop. 

The code will generate predicted pedestrian classifications and, where applicable, crossing times.

Pedestrians are sorted into classes of Passing Biker, Jaywalking, Non-Crossing, Ambiguous, Crossing, and Insufficient Data.

Within the Crossing category, pedestrians are sorted into one of 4 speed classes as a means of communicating possible risk.

For each crossing pedestrian, a crossing time is predicted.
